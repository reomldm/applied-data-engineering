A personal laboratory for applied data engineering, analytics, and economic modeling.

This repository contains daily experiments, ETL pipelines, statistical modeling tests, AWS integrations, clustering methods, and performance optimizations applied to real-world structured datasets (such as large-scale invoice data).

Focus areas:
- Data Engineering (AWS S3, Parquet, Polars, PyArrow)
- Data Cleaning & Deduplication Strategies
- Outlier Detection (Robust Z-Score, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, Isolation Forest)
- Log-Log Econometric Modeling
- Clustering & Elasticity Analysis
- Process Optimization inspired by Lean Six Sigma
